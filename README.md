# CoinCounter



Tasks:

## input validation
  
  check for what is entered and make sure it's valid

## the calculation logic:
	
	take a valid input and convert it into a penny total


  take a number, divide by biggest coin value as many times as possible  
  then try the next coin as many times as possible e.t.c until you run out
  record number of each denomination

  return an object of all the coins


functions:

1) validate input
2) convert input
3) calculate number of coins


## tests

have all the UI interaction as separate JS object - need to test this too

To do:

- convert input function
- build ui:
  - coin value styles
  - form with validaton
  - generate count for coins needed

- Make it obvious that the user has clicked Calculate
- align the centres of the coins
